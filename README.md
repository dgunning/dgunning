### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
* I am curious about the intersection of finance, data and AI
* I am a skilled Python developer with over 20 years of experience in Financial and Capital Market applications
* I am working on boosting those skills 10x using programming AI tools ... generally I like Claude Sonnet
* I tackle really hard programming problems using the boosted skills - edgartools renders HTML inside a terminal
* Oh  .. I am the maintainer of [edgartools](https://github.com/dgunning/edgartools) - easiest most powerful way to navigate SEC filings

## What I'm up to
I'm building the next phase of [edgartools](https://github.com/dgunning/edgartools) - integration into business knowledge workflows
